The main goal of this small project was to create a user-friendly photo-slider.
It has auto-slide function, also it has bottom slider, which is sincronised with the main slider. In the end of slides user can decide to switch to portret photos or just return to start.

In some points it isn't finished yet e.g. for smaller screens - that's because I didn't decided what it should look like...
